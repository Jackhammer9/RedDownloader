A very easy to use library to download videos from reddit with sound without installing external installation of ffmpeg. The library can also be used to download pictures all just with a reddit post link
note that this package does only download media from posts with images/video directly uploaded to reddit and not from sources like imgur or youtube / vimeo.

Usage:

```python
d = Downloader("clientID", "clientSecret", "userAgent")
```

this will initialize your praw bot make sure you have a registered praw application registered

```python
d.download(url)
```
This will automatically download media from the passed url it would automatically detect if it's a picture/video with default options. to pass in an output filename just pass in the output parameter as:

```python
d.download(url , output="MyAwesomeRedditMedia")
```

you don't have to pass in extensions to the output parameter

Another argument is the ```quality``` argument which defines the resolution to download if the filetype is a video the avaliable options to choose from are 360 , 720 , 1080 please note that higher resolution would result in bigger file size. An example:

```python
d.download(url , , output="MyAwesomeRedditMedia" , quality = 1080)
```

The package has been tested for videos with no sound and it works really well!
